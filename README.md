# ytt-schema-v1-preview

## Welcome and Thank You!

Greetings.

We're using the information we gather in this session to help us make the Schema feature better.

Thank you for your help!

## Setup

A few steps to take before we get going...

1. Obtain a copy of `ytt` built for this session (your guide will provide this for you).

2. Ensure that this copy of `ytt` is on your path (it's 0.35.0-preview)
   ```console
   $ ytt version
   ytt version 0.35.0-preview
   ```

2. Either clone or download a copy of this repository to your machine:
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/k14s/ytt-schema-v1-preview.git
   cd ytt-schema-v1-preview 
   ```
   
3. Let's verify that your copy of `ytt` is working:
   ```console
   ytt -f app-to-deploy/config
   ```

## Housekeeping

- **whatever occurs to you _is_ what we're most interested in** -- you are not being tested.
- **think out loud** -- your words don't have to make sense to anyone but you...

---

With that all set, let's head to our [first task](app-to-deploy/README.md).
